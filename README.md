# To-do-App

Steps to use: 
  1. Enter the todo text in the input field in the bottom.
  2. You can check the todos if they are completed.
  3. You can remove the todos you don't want in the list
  4. You can search todos or hide all completed todos.

A to-do-app used to store list of todos. Uses a few external library uuid. Made with the help of tutorials online. The difference between the previous To-do-App-legacy application and this one is that it is carried over to a webpack package and made with a compatible file structure.

To run the file in your local repository, open the root folder in your terminal and use 'npm install' to install the node modules. Then use 'npm run dev-server' to host the dev server and use 'npm run build' to build the production files.
